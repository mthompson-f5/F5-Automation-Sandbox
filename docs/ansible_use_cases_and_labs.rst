F5 Ansible 101 Lab

Once the infrastucture is up and running, you can walk through the 101 level Automation exercises for F5.

`You can run through this Ansible lab <https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/fas-ansible-workshop-101/>`_ with the F5 Automation Provisioner. This lab will cover the most common Ansible automation scenarios for F5.


Note: If you run the 101 Lab, make sure your environment is reset before running the use-cases. You can refer to the teardown section to learn more on how to reset.
